Kali Linux – Aircrack-ng
Aircrack-ng is a tool that comes pre-installed in Kali Linux and is used for wifi network security and hacking. Aircrack is an all in one packet sniffer, WEP and WPA/WPA2 cracker, analyzing tool and a hash capturing tool. It is a tool used for wifi hacking. It helps in capturing the package and reading the hashes out of them and even cracking those hashes by various attacks like dictionary attacks. It supports almost all the latest wireless interfaces. 
It mainly focuses on 4 areas:

Monitoring: Captures cap, packet, or hash files.
Attacking: Performs deauthentication or creates fake access points
Testing: Checking the wifi cards or driver capabilities
Cracking: Various security standards like WEP or WPA PSK.
# Asleap
Demonstrates a serious deficiency in proprietary Cisco LEAP networks. Since LEAP uses a variant of MS-CHAPv2 for the authentication exchange, it is susceptible to accelerated offline dictionary attacks. Asleap can also attack the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), and any MS-CHAPv2 exchange where you can specify the challenge and response values on the command line.
# Bluelog
Bluelog is a Linux Bluetooth scanner with optional daemon mode and web front-end, designed for site surveys and traffic monitoring. It's intended to be run for long periods of time in a static location to determine how many discoverable Bluetooth devices there are in the area.

Since Bluelog is meant to be run unattended, it doesn't have a user interface or require any interaction once started. It features a fully configurable log file format, as well as the ability to log to syslog for centralized logging over the network.
# BlueMaho Bluetooth Security Testing Suite
scan for devices, show advanced info, SDP records, vendor etc
track devices – show where and how much times device was seen, its name changes
loop scan – it can scan all time, showing you online devices
alerts with sound if new device found
on_new_device – you can spacify what command should it run when it founds new device
it can use separate dongles – one for scaning (loop scan) and one for running tools or exploits
send files
change name, class, mode, BD_ADDR of local HCI devices
save results in database
form nice statistics (uniq devices by day/hour, vendors, services etc)
test remote device for known vulnerabilities (see exploits for more details)
test remote device for unknown vulnerabilities (see tools for more details)
themes! you can customize it
# Crack Bluetooth Smart Encryption
Crackle cracks BLE Encryption. It exploits a flaw in the BLE pairing process that allows an attacker to guess or very quickly brute force the TK (Temporary Key). With the TK and other data collected from the pairing process, the STK (Short Term Key) and later the LTK (Long Term Key) can be collected.
# Wifite
Wifite is for Linux only.
Wifite is an automated wireless attack tool.
Wifite was designed for use with pentesting distributions of Linux, such as Kali Linux, Pentoo, BackBox; any Linux distributions with wireless drivers patched for injection. The script appears to also operate with Ubuntu 11/10, Debian 6, and Fedora 16.
Wifite must be run as root. This is required by the suite of programs it uses. Running downloaded scripts as root is a bad idea. I recommend using the Kali Linux bootable Live CD, a bootable USB stick (for persistent), or a virtual machine. Note that Virtual Machines cannot directly access hardware so a wireless USB dongle would be required.
Wifite assumes that you have a wireless card and the appropriate drivers that are patched for injection and promiscuous/monitor mode.
